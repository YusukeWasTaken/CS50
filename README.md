# **CS50x Online Course**

This are all my resolutions for the CS50 problem sets

CS50 is Harvard's entry-level computer science course. It teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. 
Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. 
Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML.
Problem sets are inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming.
